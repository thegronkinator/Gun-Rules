# Gun-Rules
Gracile’s gun rules:

Reloading:
Auto:
as your attack, roll to attack for the amount of times specified in the fire rate of the gun per attack action.

Semi-Auto:
you can only fire the weapon for the amount of ammo in its magazine per turn, if you have extra attacks and your mag has ammo, you may use it.

Ammo types:
Different ammo goes to different guns, and is measured in different ways.

Light ammo:
For weapons classified as light, be it one-handed, or lightweight but two-handed.

Medium:
For medium sized guns

Heavy:
For heavy weaponry

Darts:
For more old fashioned equipment

Shells:
For shotguns, and similar sorts of scattered weapons.

Magnet rounds:
For inserting in magnetic weapons.

Magic ammo:
For magic weapons only, rather than reloading tangible ammo, roll DC15 with your spellcasting modifier to reload.

Canisters:
For air compressor weapons.
Gun tiers:
Guns in gracile are ranked by how effective they are, and thus, which you should give to who, you don't give a toddler a rocket launcher.
