# Gun-Rules
Gracile’s gun rules:

Reloading:
Auto:
when you attack with a full auto gun,you may attack the number of times listed on the fire rate, class features may add only one extra attack, regardless of the features.

Semi-Auto:
you cannot fire a semi auto gun beyond its mag capacity regardless of class features, mag capacity is the max amount of times you can make an attack with a gun in one turn, and it should not be assumed that you can make attacks with it more then your turn with any other weapon would permit.

Ammo types:
Different ammo goes to different guns, and is measured in different ways.

Light ammo:
For weapons classified as light, be it one-handed, or lightweight but two-handed.

Medium:
For medium sized guns

Heavy:
For heavy weaponry

Darts:
For more old fashioned equipment

Shells:
For shotguns, and similar sorts of scattered weapons.

Magnet rounds:
For inserting in magnetic weapons.

Magic ammo:
For magic weapons only, rather than reloading tangible ammo, roll DC15 with your spellcasting modifier to reload.

Canisters:
For air compressor weapons.
Gun tiers:
Guns in gracile are ranked by how effective they are, and thus, which you should give to who, you don't give a toddler a rocket launcher.

Tier 1: purchasable at levels 1-5

Tier 2: purchasable at levels 6-10

Tier 3: purchasable at levels 11-15

Tier 4: purchasable at levels 16-20
